# Stereotyped goal-directed activity patterns in the insular cortex



## Description: 
This repository contains the analysis that were used to study the InsCtx activity manifolds.
(DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.13.566809)

The code is written in R and requires RStudio or an equivalent IDE to execute.

### figure_utils.R
Utility file that contains repeated functions used by the analysis

### get_red_mats.R
Code that performs dimensionality reduction / storage of reduced datasets

### matrix_presets.R
Configurations for dimensionality reductions - different algorithms and parameters

### cluster_maps.R 
Code that performs automated clustering of reduced datasets

### figure_structure_comparision.R
Code containing all the analysis to reproduce figure 1 (Comparision of the activity manifolds)

### figure_structure_parameterization.R 
Code containing all the analysis to reproduce figure 2 (Parameterization of the activity manifold with respect to behavioral variables)


### figure_structure_dynamics.R
Code containing all the analysis to reproduce figures 2-3 (Decoding across datasets, trial similarity)

### figure_structure_manipulations.R
Code containing all the analysis to reproduce figure 3 (Comparision of the activity manifold across different experimental manipulations)

### figure_structure_reward_anticipation.R
Code containing all the analysis to reproduce figure 4 (Analysis of activity manifold stereotyped dynamics with respect to reward expectation during goal-directed behavior)
